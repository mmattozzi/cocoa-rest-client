New in 1.3.2:

* Use double click to add a new row to headers, params, or files table. New rows will also be added by pressing TAB at the end of the last row being edited. Backspace key removes rows when selected.
* Added preferences menu to persist update preferences, request timeout settings, and HTTP redirect settings.
* Bugfix (Issue 15): Fixed bug where Content-Type of request can be erroneously repeated for multipart and form encoded requests.
* Bugfix (Issue 17): Automatically URL encode requests to handle non-ASCII characters. I'm amazed it took this long to catch this!

New in 1.3.1:

* Bugfix: correctly decode content served in ISO-8859-1 encoding (such as google.com)

New in 1.3.0:

* Adding import and export requests. On exports, you will be prompted to select which requests you would like to export. On imports, you will also be prompted to select which requests from the imported file you would like to add to your drawer of requests. This feature can be accessed through the file menu or request can be imported by dragging them into the drawer.

* Adding sent request headers to the response area.

* Adding ability to overwrite existing requests in the saved requests drawer by choosing File > Overwrite Request or by pressing Control-Command-S.

* Adding indefinite progress indicator that runs while requests are in progress.
